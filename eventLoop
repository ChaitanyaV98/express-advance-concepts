event loop is a core mechanism in Node js where it asynchronous i/p o/p operations without blocking on a single thread.
it keeps checking the event queue and handles the call backs

- phases include

1. timers(settimeout and setInterval)
2. pending callbacks
3. idle and prepare( this will be internally handled by nodejs)
4. poll(retrieves new i/p o/p and executes new i/p o/p related call backs)
5. check( here is where the setImmedeate function executes)
6. close call back

// also we need to know the concepts of micro and macro task
// microtask: these are operations that gets executed as soon as the current operation is done - setNexttick, promises will get handled first as part of event loop
// macro task : are the tasks that gets executed in the next iteration of the event loop like for setTimeout, setInterval and setImmedeate comes under this part.

check how the function gets executed when the timers of setTimeout, setInterval, setImmedea
